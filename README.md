# plsqlLibraryProject
I completed a PL/SQL project that focused on optimizing database management through the creation of advanced stored procedures, functions, and triggers. These PL/SQL components automated various data processing tasks, reducing manual intervention and improving overall system performance. The project also involved designing efficient SQL queries that handled large datasets, ensuring quick and accurate results. Additionally, I implemented comprehensive error handling mechanisms, including exception management, to make the database operations more robust and secure. This project helped streamline business processes and enhanced the system's ability to handle complex data operations with minimal errors.
